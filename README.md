# reCAPTCHA-V2-V3

Example of using reCaptcha V2 with V3

## Why would you combine V2 with V3?

The new feature in V3 is scores, with this you can keep track of unusual behavior.  
It's not likely to happen but if a user gets a low score i don't want to automatically label them as a bot.  
So this is where V2 comes in, this way i can give the user another chance to validate themselfs.
